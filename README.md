# PyLadies Website Redesign

Welcome! 

## Context

[pyladies.com] was designed 12 years ago, and reflects what we wanted 12 years ago.
Our needs have changed, so let's figure out what we want & need!

## How to use this repo

This repo was hastily created during PyCon 2024 sprints to collect ideas from all PyLadies interested in giving their input.
We're not trying to build a site in this repo (not yet, at least). We're merely collecting issues and tasks.

Please have a look at the current [pyladies.com] and think of ideas of what you'd like to keep, what you'd like to change, what you'd like to add or remove, and any ideas in between.

Let's also consider [kit.pyladies.com] as well!

More structure and details will come in the future. For now, this is a catch-all to collect ideas.
